<--   Micro Processor  -->

A Micro Processor is  a single integrated circuit (I/C) chip that integrates the functions of computer CPU. allowing it to process instructions and perform operations such as arithmetic, logic and data transfer.

-->Key Features:

1. Compact Design:
	Micro processors can integrate millions of transistors into a small chip.

2. Programable:
	They execute instructions written in machine or assembly language.

3. Multi Purpose:
	Used in computers, calculators, mobiles, etc.

4. Speed:
	The speed is measured in Hz(Hertz) typically in DecaHz (DHz) or GigaHz (GHz).

5. Power Consumption:
	Modern Micro Processors are designed to be power efficient.


--> Basic Components of Micro processor:

1. Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU) (eg:add,sub):  
	Perform arithmetic (+,-) and logical operation (& (and), | (or), ! (not)).

2. Control Unit (CU):
	Manages and controls the flow of data and instructions feeded  in system.

3. Registers:
	Small, fast, storage locations used for temporary data storage.

4. clock:
	Synchronizes all operations by providing timming signals.

5. Bus System:
a. Data Bus:
	Transfers data.
b. Adress Bus:
	Specifies memeory loc.
c. Control Bus:
	Carries control signals.
